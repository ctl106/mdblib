#mdblib
######A C library for interfacing with the Microchip Debugger (mdb)
------

More information will be added as development progresses.

Microchip's command line debugging tool, (mdb.sh on Linux) is needed before this library can be used. It comes along with MPLAB X IDE, so installing that software is the recommended route to take before using this library.

This project is being developed as a dependancy for xctest, inevitably facilitating the ability to interact with a simulated (or hardware, connected via a PicKit 3) Pic MCU.
